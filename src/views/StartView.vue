        The Basic Dataview Query Builder will guide you through some questions
        and put together a dataview query based on your answers. You can use this
        query as-is in your vault or as a starting point to refine a more advanced query. <br />
        The goal is to help you on your first dataview queries and to give you a
        better understanding of the syntax and needed information to build
        dataview queries from scratch.

        <a href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/">Dataview</a>
        is a popular community plugin for the Personal Knowledge Management
        software <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian.md</a>, which are both brilliant
        and highly flexible applications that can be a bit difficult to
        understand in the beginning. <br />
        To make your start into dataview a tad easier, the Basic Dataview
        Query Builder (this very webpage) allows you to click together your
        first queries that'll help you understand the syntax of the plugin and
        guide you through the different pieces of information needed to build a
        useable query. <br />
